## Terminology:

**IMU** - Inertial Measurement Unit

**DOF** - Degrees of Freedom

**Laminitis** - The inflammation of the laminae of the foot, which results in extreme pain and instability in horses.

## Project Synopsis:
A custom 9-DOF IMU with an additional 3-axis high-g accelerometer, which is used for impulses where the low-g accelerometer may clip, will be used to detect laminitis or rotational hoof sickness, in racehorses.
The IMUs come equipped with a 3-axis low-g accelerometer, 3-axis high-g accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, and 3-axis magnetometer. Additionally, circuitry will be added for other features like GPS, Real-time timekeeping, and power management.

The IMUs will communicate directly to a central hub through a BLE mesh, which will allow wireless transmission of recorded data from each unique IMU device. After data collection, the data will be read from the central into a serial port on a computer where it will save the data and provide a real-time plot for data processing later.


## Goals:
- [x]  Test with mobile battery pack                                                      
- [x]  Add Timestamp to periphal data packet                                              
- [x]  Distance/Reliablility measurement                                                  ~40 ft
- [x]  Complete power management system                                                   
- [x]  Complete real-time plotting using BetterSerialMonitor                              
- [ ]  Integrate GPS into the IMU system                                                  No Longer Feasbile due to Time Constraints
- [ ]  Complete PCB design with integrated circuits and order appropriate chips           Future Goal
