# Battery Management system
Battery Management System is a critical component in modern battery-powered systems, playing a vital role in maximizing battery lifespan, performance, and safety while also enabling efficient energy management.
## Important factors to consider for BMS 
- Voltage Monitoring
- Current Monitoring
- Temperature Monitoring
- Cell Balancing
- State of Charge (SOC) Estimation
- State of Health (SOH) Estimation
- Overcurrent and Overvoltage Protection
- Cell Protection

## Battery we are using 
Voltage = 3.7 v 
capacity = 650mAh 
capacity = 1500mAh 

 

## Estimated components 




## Monitoring test  ( using SparkFun battery babysitter) 


## Monitoring test 2 ( using IN219) 

Components 
BQ24075 x 1
USB C x 1
Variety of SMD Resistors x 17
Variety of SMD capacitors x 5

Update first test pending due to DATA cable, code compiles but doesn't run (COM PORT issue)
