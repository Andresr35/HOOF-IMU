# Battery Management system
Battery Management System is a critical component in modern battery-powered systems, playing a vital role in maximizing battery lifespan, performance, and safety while also enabling efficient energy management.
## Important factors to consider for BMS 
- Voltage Monitoring
- Current Monitoring
- Temperature Monitoring
- Cell Balancing
- State of Charge (SOC) Estimation
- State of Health (SOH) Estimation
- Overcurrent and Overvoltage Protection
- Cell Protection

## Proportional Integral Derivative (PID)
![PID of battery](https://github.com/kyobg/HOOF-IMU/assets/36013919/ef0b7d8d-5c7f-45e4-a22c-6c92db55050d)


## Battery we are using 
*Voltage = 3.7 v 
*capacity = 650mAh 
*capacity = 1500mAh
An individual LiPo cell has a nominal voltage of 3.7V. When fully charged you will see nearly 4.3V on the cell but it will quickly drop to 3.7V under normal use. When depleted, the cell will be around 3V. This means your project will need to handle various voltages if you are running directly from a cell.
