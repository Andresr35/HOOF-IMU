# Battery Management system
Battery Management System is a critical component in modern battery-powered systems, playing a vital role in maximizing battery lifespan, performance, and safety while also enabling efficient energy management.
## Important factors to consider for BMS 
- Voltage Monitoring
- Current Monitoring
- Temperature Monitoring
- Cell Balancing
- State of Charge (SOC) Estimation
- State of Health (SOH) Estimation
